  summary: Create a new shipment for a sales order
  description: |
    Create a new shipment record for a specific sales order. Once the shipment is added, 
    the sales order status will automatically be updated to either `shipped` or `partially_shipped`.
    Also, any shipment costs will be added to the sales order total.
    NOTE: At this time, inventory adjustments will not be made automatically.
