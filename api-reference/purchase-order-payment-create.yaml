  summary: Create a payment for a purchase order
  description: |
    Create a new payment for a purchase order. The purchase order totals (`total_paid` and `total_due`) 
    are automatically recalculated after the payment is created.
    
    ## Payment Types
    Valid payment types: `cash`, `credit_card`, `debit_card`, `check`, `bank_transfer`
    
    ## Total Recalculation
    After creating a payment, the system automatically:
    - Updates `total_paid` by adding the new payment amount
    - Recalculates `total_due` as `total_cost - total_paid`
