  summary: Company Products with Pricing
  description: |
    Get a paginated list of ALL products with company-specific pricing applied.
    Unlike the `/companies/{companyId}/products` endpoint which only returns products 
    assigned to the company's B2B template, this endpoint returns ALL products in the 
    system with pricing calculated based on the company's price levels and groups.
    
    The `price` field will contain the calculated price for each product based on:
    - Company's assigned price groups and levels
    - Product category-specific pricing rules
    - Applicable discounts or markups
    
    For detailed information about the filtering system and available operators, 
    refer to the [Filter System Documentation](/filters).
