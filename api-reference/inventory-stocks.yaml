    ## ⚠️ Important: Default Sorting and Pagination

    **By default, results are sorted by `updated_at` in descending order.** This field changes frequently as stock levels are updated, which can cause issues when paginating through results:
    
    - Items may be skipped or duplicated between pages
    - The same item may appear on multiple pages
    - Some items may never appear if they're updated while you're paginating
    
    **Recommendation:** When pulling all stocks or paginating through large datasets, use a more stable sort field such as:
    - `product.id:asc` - Sort by product ID (most stable)
    - `product.sku:asc` - Sort by product SKU
    - `product.name:asc` - Sort by product name
    
    Example: `?sort=product.id:asc&per_page=100`

    ## Available Sort Fields

    - `product.id` - Sort by product ID
    - `product.sku` - Sort by product SKU
    - `product.name` - Sort by product name
    - `updated_at` - Sort by last stock update date (default: `updated_at:desc`)

    Sort format: `field:direction` where direction is `asc` (ascending) or `desc` (descending).
    
    Examples:
    - `?sort=product.id:asc` - Sort by product ID ascending
    - `?sort=product.sku:desc` - Sort by product SKU descending
    - `?sort=product.name:asc` - Sort by product name ascending
    - `?sort=updated_at:asc` - Sort by update date ascending (overrides default)
