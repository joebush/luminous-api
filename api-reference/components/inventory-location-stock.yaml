      Current landed unit cost from the oldest active cost layer with remaining quantity for this specific warehouse.
      The cost is derived from cost layers using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) logic, selecting the oldest cost layer 
      that has a remaining quantity greater than zero. Returns null if no active cost layer exists.
